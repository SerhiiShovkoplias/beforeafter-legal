<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: January 2026</em></p>

<h2>1. Overview</h2>
<p>
This application (“the App”) is designed to create before/after photo and video comparisons.
All processing is performed entirely on the user’s device.
The developer does not collect, store, transmit, or access user content.
</p>

<h2>2. Photos and Videos</h2>
<p>
The App allows users to select photos and videos from their device for local processing.
All media is processed using iOS system frameworks directly on the device.
</p>
<p>
Photos and videos are:
</p>
<p>
– Never uploaded to any server<br>
– Never stored by the developer<br>
– Never shared with third parties<br>
– Never accessed by the developer
</p>
<p>
Selected media is used only temporarily to generate the requested output and remains fully under the user’s control.
</p>

<h2>3. Data Collection</h2>
<p>
The App does not collect or process personal information, including but not limited to:
</p>
<p>
– Names or contact details<br>
– Email addresses<br>
– User accounts or profiles<br>
– Location data<br>
– Photos or videos<br>
– Usage data linked to an individual user
</p>

<h2>4. Analytics and Tracking</h2>
<p>
The App does not use analytics services, advertising SDKs, or tracking technologies.
User activity is not tracked across apps or websites.
</p>

<h2>5. In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>
The App offers optional subscriptions processed through Apple’s In-App Purchase system.
All payments and transaction handling are performed by Apple.
</p>
<p>
The developer does not receive or store payment information.
Apple may process transaction data in accordance with Apple’s own Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Storage</h2>
<p>
The App does not operate backend servers or external databases.
Any exported images or videos are saved locally on the user’s device and can be managed or deleted by the user at any time.
</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
The App does not knowingly collect personal data from children.
Because no personal data is collected, the App does not maintain user profiles of any kind.
</p>

<h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy may be updated if the App’s functionality changes.
Any updates will be reflected by revising the “Last updated” date above.
